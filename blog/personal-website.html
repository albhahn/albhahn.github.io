    <p>My experience of building this website has been really good for my learning. I started with a blank page and a wireframe. Through the process, I made a lot of updates, changes, and additions to the website. It's definitely not the best looking website but the fact that its unique from my creation is still something that I'm happy about. A couple things I learned about developing through all of this is that you need to be creative and always look for possible improvements, then implement them.</p>
