      Version Control is a system or software that allows you to keep track of all your files and save different "versions" of them with the changes you've made. So if at any point you were dissatisfied with any changes or just wanted to review them, you can go back to previous versions. While version control is very helpful to keep track of your own files, it can be of more use with collaborators and team members.

        Git, which is a version control system (VCS) allows team members to interact by working on any same file(s) at the same time without overwriting anothers changes. Git is designed to help track files by using a "tree" type of system, where there will be a master branch that a team can work on by adding changes or features. They can do this by creating branches of their own from the master and add changes to test out. Once fully tested, they can be merged back into the master branch. Git also uses something called a "commit", which is used after you've made changes or finished a task. Commits are a snapshot of your code, which is like an official saving point that also provides a "commit message", describing the changes. GitHub is a great remote repository to store all of your files/code.

        GitHub is like a social media website for developers. Not only are all programmers on there but you can see what they're working on, network with likeminded individuals, and make suggestions/changes. GitHub.com provides online repositories that you can create, which is where developers can store their projects. Additionally, GitHub is "open source", which means all of their code is easily inspected and freely distributed.
