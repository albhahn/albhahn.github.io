      Understanding how to format each one is extremely vital to sizing every element in CSS and how sensitive they can all be when attemping to display them the way you'd like, so lets get into each one.

      Margin is the area around the entire element and can clear areas around the border. Padding is whats right around the main content and will also effect the area inside the content. The difference between margin and padding is that, while padding deals with inner space, margin deals with outer space to the next outer element. Borders on the other hand are outside of the content and defines the edge of an element.
