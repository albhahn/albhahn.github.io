<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was very helpful, my pair was able to solidify some things I wasn't sure about and referred some semantic elements I did not know about.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I did, it was helpful because it really is like a blueprint.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Yes, I think we even added one too many things for this challenge that we couldn't get to in the HTML portion.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
<aside> and <nav> are the two that I learned about.
