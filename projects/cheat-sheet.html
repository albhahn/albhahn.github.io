      <h1>A Cheat Sheet for JavaScript Objects</h1>
      <p>Objects in JavaScript are composed of attributes. If an attribute contains a function, it is considered to be a method of the object, otherwise the attribute is considered a property.</p>

      <h2>Object Properties</h2>
        <p>Object properties can be any of the three primitive data types, or any of the abstract data types, such as another object. Object properties are usually variables that are used internally in the object's methods, but can also be globally visible variables that are used throughout the page.</p>
        <p>The syntax for adding a property to an object is −</p>
        <code>objectName.objectProperty = propertyValue;</code>
        <p>For example − The following code gets the document title using the "title" property of the document object.</p>
        <code>var str = document.title;</code>

        <h2>Object Methods</h2>
        <p>Methods are the functions that let the object do something or let something be done to it. There is a small difference between a function and a method – at a function is a standalone unit of statements and a method is attached to an object and can be referenced by the this keyword.</p>

        <p>Methods are useful for everything from displaying the contents of the object to the screen to performing complex mathematical operations on a group of local properties and parameters.</p>

        <p>For example − Following is a simple example to show how to use the write() method of document object to write any content on the document.</p>

        <code>document.write("This is test");</code>

        <h2>User-Define Objects</h2>
        <p>All user-defined objects and built-in objects are descendants of an object called Object.</p>
        <h4>The new Operator</h4>
        <p>The new operator is used to create an instance of an object. To create an object, the new operator is followed by the constructor method. In the following example, the constructor methods are Object(), Array(), and Date(). These constructors are built-in JavaScript functions.</p>
        <code>var employee = new Object();</code>
        <code>var books = new Array("C++", "Perl", "Java");</code>
        <code>var day = new Date("August 15, 1947");</code>
        <h4>The Object() Constructor</h4>
        <p>A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object. JavaScript provides a special constructor function called Object() to build the object. The return value of the Object() constructor is assigned to a variable. The variable contains a reference to the new object. The properties assigned to the object are not variables and are not defined with the var keyword.</p>
