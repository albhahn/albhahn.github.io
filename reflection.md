##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?##
I learned that knowing how to format each one is incredibly vital to sizing every element in CSS and how sensitive they can all be when attempting to display them the way that you'd like.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?##
I learned that there is a TON of trial-and-error when it comes to positioning and that it is much more complex than I had originally imagined.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?##
Formatting images and text were probably the easiest for me, whereas formatting in-line blocks seemed to be much harder for me to position where I would've liked.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?##
I learned a ton and the importance of understanding the different positioning properties (static, relative, fixed, absolute, etc..) and how each works is huge. There's also so much attention to little detail and so much time that needs to go into them. CSS positioning was very difficult for me to grasp this week and I hope I can improve my skills as I feel like CSS proved to be a weakpoint for me. Even with so much time spent, I feel like theres a lot more practice that I need.
