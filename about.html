      <h3> Who I am: </h3>
      <p> My name is Albert Hahn, I was born in January of 1988. I grew up in Diamond Bar, California, which is a small suburban city about 40 minutes east of downtown Los Angeles. Growing up in southern California has helped me learn so much about different cultures and diversity all in one small part of the world. In return, I believe it had a big impact on my personality, values, and who I am today as a whole.</p>
      <h3> Some interests/hobbies: </h3>
      <p> I love technology, gaming, sports/fantasy sports, cultural food, snowboarding, nature(hiking), music(concerts/festivals), and so much more.. (We haven't even gone in depth with anything listed!)</p>
      <h3> Something quirky about me: </h3>
      <p> My first career was as a professional gamer in the team game of Counter-Strike, which at one point I was actually getting paid a hefty (for a late teenager) salary. It was an amazing experience, one of which where I learned the strength of passion and dedication, and how far it can take you. In a way, it even helped me pick the computer programming program that I did (Dev Bootcamp), because of their importance on their students passion and desire to create meaningful projects by fully immersing/dedicating to oneself. After a couple different other careers, I'm now pursuing my profession as a full-time developer/engineer in the ever-growing world of technology. Even though I know I can potentially be a professional gamer again or even a professional fantasy sports player? (Probably analyst haha), I know that this is the path for me and I want to see where it will lead me. </p>
